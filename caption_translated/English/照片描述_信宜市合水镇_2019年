Heshui Town, Xinyi City, 2019.

She is a mentally ill woman of about 40 years old. Trafficked here about 20 years ago. She tried to escape and was caught. The traffickers slashed her back and arms with knives, and a large piece of her left shoulder was cut off, leaving a sunken scar to this day. She went completely insane after. She was sold to an old bachelor to be his wife. The old bachelor who bought her forced her to have a baby and then sold her to another man. The local villagers could not tell how many times she was changed hands. Some said twice, and some said three or four times. Until a 70-year-old man who lived alone took her in.
