In 2016, Maoming City.

A mentally ill woman is grabbing a Coke from her daughter. Twenty years ago, she was bought by her husband from human traffickers and gave birth to two daughters. She later ran away from home and was hit by a car on the road, losing her right arm and toe. To prevent her from getting lost again, her husband locked her in the utility room.
